# Introduction
The FAIR Metroline provides practical guidance to help you reach your FAIR goals and make your data more FAIR. Each Metroline step includes a short description, aimed at a general audience, as well as a section describing the expertise that may be necessary for the how-to section. This expertise can vary greatly per step and may include, for example, domain experts, software engineers or legal professionals. Given the time commitment and specialised knowledge needed, most steps will require the expertise of at least a data steward.

The development of the FAIR Metroline is currently ongoing in Confluence. To enhance flexibility and improve findability, we are transferring both published pages and those available for external review to this web-based version.

More information will follow in this README soon.
