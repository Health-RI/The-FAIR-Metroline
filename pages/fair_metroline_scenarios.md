The FAIR Metroline provides you with FAIR guidance. However, which steps are actually relevant for your FAIRification journey depends on your FAIR objectives. For example, if your objective is to make your existing data Findable and Accessible in a catalogue, a step like Design eCRF will not be relevant.

This section provides guidance for common FAIR objectives through FAIR scenarios.
