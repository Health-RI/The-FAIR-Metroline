/**
 * This file is needed to expose the interactive metroline SVG as a direct, standalone URL
 * (e.g. /assets/includes/metroline_interactive.svg.html) that can be fetched via JavaScript.
 *
 * Why not just link directly to _includes/metroline_interactive.svg.html?
 * → Because Jekyll does not render files in _includes/ directly to accessible URLs.
 *    They are meant for template inclusion only.
 *
 * Why do we include the file here?
 * → This includes the actual SVG HTML content that lives in _includes/metroline_interactive.svg.html.
 *    We manage the SVG in _includes/ so it can be reused inside other layouts as well.
 *
 * Specifically, we need this file in downloadMetroline.js where we take the svg.html and turn it
 * into two downloadable svg versions. This way, we only have to maintain the svg.html version instead
 * of three variants.
