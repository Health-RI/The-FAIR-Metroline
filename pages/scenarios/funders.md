## Background
I'm a researcher and I got a grant proposal approved by ZonMw. 
I want to understand the steps I need to take to comply with these requirements and ensure that my data meets the FAIR requirements.

## Scenario Overview
As a researcher I need to know who's responsible to make FAIR happen within my organization. 
It's my responsibility because the grant is mine. 

As part of the funding agreement, I need to ensure that my research data is made FAIR in accordance with ZonMw's FAIR data management policy.
