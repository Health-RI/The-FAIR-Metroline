## Background

You need to process tumour sequencing data to extract key genomic alterations. Cancer genomics portals help you explore and share these results, but they require data in a specific structured format.



## Scenario Overview

You start with raw tumour sequencing files, run an analysis workflow to generate variants and copy number profiles, then format the outputs so they can be uploaded to a cancer genomics portal for exploration.
