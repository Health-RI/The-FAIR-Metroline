'Metadata is the descriptor, and data is the thing being described' (FAIR Principles: Interpretations and Implementation Considerations)

Metadata describes a resource, like a book’s title and author or a photo’s date and location, which help with organization and discovery of that resource. This Metroline step describes the types of metadata, where you can find them for your resource, and how to improve their quality. Filling metadata gaps enhances a resource’s visibility and reusability.
