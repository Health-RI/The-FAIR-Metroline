## Overview Metroline steps

**[Define FAIRification Objectives](metroline_steps/define_fairification_objectives)**. FAIRification objectives aim to make data more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). They focus on improving how data is organised and shared, ensuring that it can be easily accessed, understood and used by both humans and machines. Achieving such objectives maximises the value of data, enhancing its usefulness and long-term usability.  

**[Have a FAIR data steward on board](metroline_steps/have_a_fair_data_steward_on_board)**. A FAIR data steward guides teams in organising, storing, and describing data to meet the FAIR principles, ensuring research data can be understood and reused, making science more efficient and transparent.

**[Pre-FAIR Assesment](metroline_steps/pre_fair_assessment).** A pre-FAIR assessment evaluates the current state of your data and its alignment with the FAIR principles. Performing this assessment early makes you aware of possibilities for increasing the FAIRness of your data, which in turn increases its impact and ensures its long-term usability.
