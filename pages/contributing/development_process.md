This page needs to be improved to highlight that we have Confluence and GitHub pages. Also, the status flag is not correctly highlighted yet. TODO.

## Page development phases
While writing and reviewing it is important to keep in mind that the aim of the FAIR Metroline is to provide readers FAIRification guidance in an **understandable** and **applicable** way. Each page is designed to be user-friendly, with clear headings, concise language, and practical examples. After reading a page, a user should be able to understand the problem, take practical steps towards the solution, and apply the FAIR principles to their own research projects. Pages go through the development phases described below.
* <span style="color: purple;">**STATUS: FUTURE WORK.**</span> This status indicates that work on this page wonâ€™t be started any time soon.   
* <span style="color: grey;">**STATUS: PLANNED.**</span> This status indicates that this page has been planned for development.   
* <span style="color: red;">**STATUS: IN DEVELOPMENT.**</span> This status shows that active work is being done to create the content by the Writing group. See [Writing group](#writing-group) for more information.
* <span style="color: orange;">**STATUS: READY FOR REVIEW.**</span> At this stage, the content is drafted and checked on quality. Constructive feedback is provided by the [Reviewing group](#reviewing-group), and revisions are made as necessary. See Reviewing group for more information. 
* <span style="color: green;">**STATUS: RELEASED.**</span> This status indicates that the content has been released by the Editorial board and is available for public use. See [Editorial process](#editorial-board) for details.

Updates to status are made by the Editorial board to ensure that all pages are accurately tracked and maintained throughout their lifecycle. This structured approach allows for a clear workflow and accountability, ensuring that the information provided is both current and reliable.

## Content of the FAIR Metroline
The FAIR Metroline is a Health-RI community effort and decisions are driven by consensus among all contributors (writers, reviewers and editors). 

The content of the FAIR Metroline will be periodically updated, based on contributions from the writers and reviewers. The Editorial board will ensure that the content represents the majority opinion and that the various perspectives of contributors are taken into account.

Kindly contact <fairservicedesk@health-ri.nl> if you consider any content to be incorrect.

## Writing group
Contributing to the FAIR Metroline is a collaborative and structured process that ensures the content is accurate, comprehensive, and valuable. As part of the Writing group, you have full rights on the FAIR Metroline Confluence pages. Furthermore, you are added to the dedicated Slack channel. You will be mentioned in the Writers' section on the [Contributors page]({{site.baseurl}}/contributing/contributors#cur-writers). 

As a writer, keep in mind the following:
* You are expected to co-create pages. 
* You are expected to provide feedback on pages written by other members of the Writing group. See [Metroline: Page feedback status (Writing group)](https://health-ri.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FSD/pages/392200208) (restricted access).
* To get a clear understanding of what is expected in each section of a FAIR Metroline page, study the template.
* Adhere to the [Style guide]({{site.baseurl}}/contributing/style_guide).

Suggested approach for writing a page 
* **Brainstorming.** Start with a braindump and add everything you can think of. Research your topic and look for existing best-practices in sources such as the [FAIR Cookbook](https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org/content/home.html), [RMDkit](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/), [Turing way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html) and [FAIR Sharing](https://fairsharing.org/). Feel free to add other high quality sources and notify the Editorial board if you have general resources, which should be added to the list.
* **Drafting.** 
  * Add your text by mentioning your name between brackets, followed by the text. For example, *\[Sander\] This is my text*. 
  * Draft a clear outline that structures the content logically. Include main headings and subheadings to organize the information. 
  * Define the key messages and objectives for the page. What should readers learn or be able to do after reading the page? 
  * Where appropriate, include examples, case studies, diagrams, or other visuals to illustrate points and enhance understanding.
* **Collaboration.** Co-write with members from the Writing group. Some of us meet every Friday in Utrecht to co-write, but feel free to plan co-write sessions whenever you deem suitable.
* **Notification.** When the writers feel the page is ready, notify the Editorial board and they will start the feedback process.
* **Revisions.** Resolve the provided feedback, ensure your page follows the Style guide and notify the Editorial board.

## Reviewing group
The reviewing process for contributions is critical to ensure that content is accurate, reliable, and valuable to readers. This process involves multiple steps and participants, ensuring thorough evaluation and quality control. 

As part of the Reviewing group, you have comment rights on the FAIR Metroline Confluence pages. You will be mentioned in the Reviewers' section on the [Contributors page]({{site.baseurl}}/contributing/contributors#cur-reviewers) 

As a reviewer, keep in mind the following:
* You are expected to review pages
    * The Editorial board will communicate with timeline when and which pages are available for review after the monthly board meeting. Pages will be available for review for two weeks.
* **Review process**
  * **Content accuracy.** Reviewers thoroughly evaluate the accuracy of the information. They check facts, figures, and references to ensure that all information is correct and up-to-date.
  * **Clarity and readability.** Reviewers assess whether the content is clearly written and easy to understand. They check for logical flow, clear explanations, and appropriate use of language.
  * **Relevance and value.** Reviewers ensure that the content is relevant to the intended audience and provides valuable insights or guidance. They assess whether the content meets the objectives defined in the outline.
* **Feedback and suggestions**
  * **Constructive feedback.** Reviewers provide detailed feedback, highlighting strengths and identifying areas for improvement. This includes suggestions for enhancing clarity, adding missing information, or correcting inaccuracies.
  * **Specific comments.** Reviewers may use tools such as comments or track changes to provide specific notes within the document. This helps the author understand exactly where changes are needed. Please make sure the suggestions are constructive and respectful. 
* **Page revision**
  * **Incorporating feedback.** The Editorial board and, where necessary, page authors review the feedback and make necessary revisions. This may involve rewriting sections, adding new information, or adjusting formatting. Contributors may contact you to further clarify/discuss a suggestion. 
    * Note that even though all suggestions will be taken seriously, not all will necessarily be adopted and some suggestions will be considered future work.
    * You will not receive specific details on how your feedback was addressed. If you would like these details, please contact the Editorial board.
  * **Release.** Once all revisions are resolved, the Editorial board releases the page.

To reduce expenses, the Editorial board regularly checks whether Confluence accounts are actively used and disables the inactive ones. To reactivate a disabled account, please send an email to <fairservicedesk@health-ri.nl>.

## Editorial board

* **Prioritising and planning**
  * **Page prioritisation.** Decide which pages need to be developed or updated based on the overall strategic goals and plateau planning. This ensures that the most critical content is prioritized.
  * **Development tracking.** Monitor the progress of each page through its development stages. Update the status of pages to reflect their current phase (FUTURE WORK, IN DEVELOPMENT, etc).
* **Feedback and review coordination**
  * **Ensure feedback.** Make sure that the Writing group consistently provides feedback on each other's drafts. This collaborative approach helps improve the quality of content.
  * **Notify reviewers.** Inform the Reviewing group and other stakeholders when pages are ready for review. Use multiple channels to communicate this:
