    We are proud to announce that the first three pages of the FAIR Metroline have now been published
      * Define FAIRification objectives - FAIRification objectives aim to make data more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). They focus on improving how data is organised and shared, ensuring that it can be easily accessed, understood and used by both humans and machines. Achieving such objectives maximises the value of data, enhancing its usefulness and long-term usability.
      * Have a FAIR data steward on board - A FAIR data steward guides teams in organising, storing, and describing data to meet the FAIR principles, ensuring research data can be understood and reused, making science more efficient and transparent.
      * Pre-FAIR assessment - A pre-FAIR assessment evaluates the current state of your data and its alignment with the FAIR principles. Performing this assessment early makes you aware of possibilities for increasing the FAIRness of your data, which in turn increases its impact and ensures its long-term usability.

    We are pleased to announce that two new pages are now ready for external review:
      * Register resource level metadata - To make your resource (e.g. data), available for reuse, its metadata can be published in a catalogue. This step helps you find a catalogue where you can register these resource metadata and explains why adding your resource to such a catalogue is important.
      * Assess availability of your metadata - Metadata describes a resource, like a book’s title and author or a photo’s date and location, which help with organization and discovery of that resource. This Metroline step describes the types of metadata, where you can find them for your resource, and how to improve their quality. Filling metadata gaps enhances a resource’s visibility and reusability.
