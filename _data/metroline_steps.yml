  title: Define FAIRification objectives
  summary: FAIRification objectives aim to make data more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). They focus on improving how data is organised and shared, ensuring that it can be easily accessed, understood and used by both humans and machines. Achieving such objectives maximises the value of data, enhancing its usefulness and long-term usability.

  title: Pre-FAIR assessment
  summary: A pre-FAIR assessment evaluates the current state of your data and its alignment with the FAIR principles. Performing this assessment early makes you aware of possibilities for increasing the FAIRness of your data, which in turn increases its impact and ensures its long-term usability.

  title: Design Solution Plan
  summary: This step is about turning the findings from the pre-FAIR assessment into a clear, actionable plan. It means choosing the right tools, deciding who does what, and making sure the process is simple and effective so data can actually become FAIR.

  title: Assess availability of your metadata
  summary: Metadata describes a resource, like a book’s title and author or a photo’s date and location, which help with organization and discovery of that resource. This Metroline step describes the types of metadata, where you can find them for your resource, and how to improve their quality. Filling metadata gaps enhances a resource’s visibility and reusability.

  title: Register resource level metadata
  summary: To make your resource (e.g. data), available for reuse, its metadata can be published in a catalogue. This step helps you find a catalogue where you can register these resource metadata and explains why adding your resource to such a catalogue is important.

  title: Analyse data semantics
  summary: In this step, the aim is to gain more insight into the existing data, or the data that you aim to collect. Clearly defining the meaning (semantics) of the data is an important step for creating the semantic model, as well as for data collection via, for example, electronic case report forms (eCRFs).
