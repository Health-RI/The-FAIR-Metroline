  gaps_and_needs:
    Gaps:
      - eConsent awareness - Due to recent METc regulations, digital informed consent is/will be required for study participants. To comply, research teams must be made aware of this change, and suitable eConsent tools must be available. Castor eConsent supports this requirement and can be integrated directly with Castor EDC.
      - Tool onboarding validation - New tools like eConsent must be validated against institute security policies (like TraIT did for Ldot)
      - CTMS discontinuation - Castor no longer offers CTMS for new clients, creating fragmentation in tooling
