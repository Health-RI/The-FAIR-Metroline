  short_description: "Clearly define what you want to achieve with FAIRification."
  description: "Rita defined her objectives: make the dataset findable in the institutional catalog to comply with RUMC policy."
  examples:
    - role: "Radboud UMC Researcher"
      description: "I need to make my clinical trial data findable in the institutional catalog before I can submit my grant report. My objective is to register the dataset with minimal metadata required by the institution."
    - role: "UMC Utrecht Data Steward"
      description: "I'm helping multiple researchers register their datasets. My objective is to establish a streamlined workflow that meets both institutional requirements and FAIR principles."
    - role: "PhD Student"
      description: "My supervisor asked me to make my research data available. I want to understand what 'findable' means and what minimum steps I need to take."

  short_description: "Get support from someone experienced in FAIR data management."
  description: "Rita contacted the institutional data steward who will guide her through the process and provide technical support."
  examples:
    - role: "Radboud UMC Researcher"
      description: "I contacted Jane from the research data office. She will help me identify what metadata I need and where to register my dataset."
    - role: "Independent Researcher"

  status: "active"
  icon: "📋"
  short_description: "Check what metadata you already have and what's missing."
  description: "Rita needs to inventory existing metadata about her dataset (title, description, keywords, etc.) and identify gaps that need to be filled before registration."
  examples:
    - role: "Radboud UMC Researcher"
      description: "I have my research protocol with the study description, but I need to check if I have all required fields like keywords, contact information, and access conditions."
    - role: "Data Manager"
      description: "I'm reviewing our data management plan to extract metadata. I need to verify license information and ensure we have proper consent for data sharing."

- title: "Register resource level metadata"
  status: "upcoming"
  icon: "📝"
  short_description: "Register your dataset in a catalog or repository."
  description: "Once metadata is complete, Rita will register the dataset in the institutional catalog, making it discoverable for others."
  examples:
    - role: "Radboud UMC Researcher"
      description: "I'll use the institutional catalog interface to register my dataset with all the metadata I've gathered."
    - role: "Multi-site Study Coordinator"
      description: "I need to register the same dataset in multiple institutional catalogs and ensure consistency across registrations."

- title: "Apply metadata model"
  status: "suggestion"
  icon: "💡"
  short_description: "Optional: Use a standardized metadata schema for better interoperability."
  description: "For enhanced findability and interoperability, consider applying a standardized metadata model like Dublin Core, DataCite, or domain-specific schemas."
  examples:
    - role: "Data Steward"
      description: "I want to ensure our metadata is compatible with national and international catalogs, so I'll map our fields to the DataCite schema."

- title: "Register structural metadata"
  status: "suggestion"
  icon: "💡"
  short_description: "Optional: Document the structure and format of your data."
  description: "Go a step further by documenting the internal structure of your dataset (variables, data types, relationships) to make it even more reusable."
  examples:
    - role: "Database Administrator"
      description: "I'll document our database schema so others can understand the data structure without contacting us."
